# BlackChat

A chat application built using:
- Redis
- Pub/Sub (redis)
- Express

I used ths [tutorial](https://blog.manifold.co/building-a-chat-room-in-30-minutes-using-redis-socket-io-and-express-9e8e5a578675) to come up with this.

## Installation
To make use of this, you have to install `redis` on your PC.
- If you're using a mac, simply run the command from your terminal `brew install redis`.
- Create a copy of the `.env.sample` file and name it `.env` and supply the information contained there.
- Then run the `./setup.sh` command to set up all dependency and start the application.
